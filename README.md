# trex-warrior
A remake of the Amiga classic Trex Warrior

This remake uses OpenGL and its own simple game programming library, all written in C++. The game is unfinished. Most of the game features are implemented, but only the first level has been designed.

Pre-built Windows binaries are available at https://github.com/abainbridge/trex-warrior/blob/master/builds
